# grunt-init-webepsb
Create a web app with Express and grunt automation for Pug templating engine, Stylus css preprocessor and Browserify

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][]
[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

Once grunt is installed place this template in your `~/.grunt-init` directory.
It's recommended that you git clone the repository into the directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/AHaliq/grunt-init-webepsb.git ~/.grunt-init/webepsb
```

## Usage
At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.
```
grunt-init-webepsb
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
